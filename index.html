        <blockquote> 
          I am here before you as one of the biggest conundrums in the world. There never was a weaker man on the platform. Language? None. Inabilityâ€“full of it. All natural things in my life point exactly opposite to my being able to stand on the platform and preach the gospel. The secret is that the Holy Ghost came and brought this wonderful edification of the Spirit. I had been reading this Word continually as well as I could, but the Holy Ghost came and took hold of it, for the Holy Ghost is the breath of it, and He illuminated it to me.
